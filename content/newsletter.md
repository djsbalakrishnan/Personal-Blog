#### Hey, there! 
Alright, so here's the deal with the newsletter – you're probably wondering what's actually going to land in your inbox each week, right? Think of it as your go-to buddy for all things beginner software engineering.

First up, we're going to tackle one Leetcode Problem of the Week. The goal here isn't just to throw a problem at you and say "good luck!" Instead, I'll try to frame it in a way that helps you understand the underlying concepts and maybe even give you a little nudge in the right direction without giving away the whole farm. Think of it as a weekly brain workout to sharpen those DSA skills.

Then, I'll be sharing Projects and Articles that I find interesting throughout the week. This could be anything from a cool open-source project on GitHub to an insightful article on Y-Combinator. I'll share why I found them interesting and what you, can learn from them.

We'll also have a section on Tools for Software Engineers. This won't just be about fancy software. Sometimes the most helpful tools are as simple as a good notebook and pen or a reliable task management app. I'll share some of the things I find useful in my own learning journey.

Finally, because music can be a great companion while studying, I'll include Updates to my Study With Me Music playlist or share a Song of the Week that's been keeping me motivated. Maybe you'll discover some new tunes to help you focus too.

So, that's what you can expect – a mix of practical problem-solving, interesting insights from the engineering world, useful tools, and some musical motivation to keep you going. Sound good?
