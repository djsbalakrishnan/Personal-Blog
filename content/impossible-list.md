For all of you who are wondering what an impossible list is, let me borrow a few sentences from Thomas Frank who was my inspiration for creating my own Impossible list.

> The impossible list is an ever-evolving list of experiences that build upon each other, help others as well as yourself, and implore you to take action.

Here is mine.
