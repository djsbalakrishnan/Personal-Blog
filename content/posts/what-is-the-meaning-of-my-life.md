As far as I can remember, I have pondered about the meaning of my life every now and then. Everytime I look for inspiration, I refer to articles, books and interviews of Mr. Ratan Tata, Mr. APJ Abdul Kalam, Mr. Warren Buffet, and Mr. Charlie Munger try to understand the path that they have travelled and try to visualize myself following a similar path to the best of my abilities. The more I think about it today, I have come to realize that I have been spending a long time pondering without taking any action.
