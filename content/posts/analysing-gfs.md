Distributed systems aren't learned by memorizing definitions. They are learned by studying the trade-offs made by the giants.

The **Google File System (GFS)** paper (2003) is the grandfather of modern Big Data (HDFS, S3, **Colossus**). But let's be honest—reading a 15-page academic paper is dry.

I spent the weekend breaking down the paper and annotating the critical architectural decisions.

Here is the PDF with my highlights and architectural sketches.

### 2. Join the Live Deep Dive (Jan 18)
The notes are the *what*. The class is the *why*.

I am hosting a live, engineer-to-engineer breakdown of this architecture. We will go beyond the paper and discuss how this evolved into **Colossus** and why modern object stores look different.

**When:** **Saturday, Jan 18** from **11:00 AM - 1:00 PM IST**
