![MountainRanges](/images/Goals2023.jpg)

#### 1. Get to Ideal Weight

Thanks to my sedentary lifestyle, I am currently 10 Kg overweight. I wish to get fit this year by working out often and taking short walks to improve my metabolism.

#### 2. Follow the two-day rule for Meditation
 
I tried my hand at Meditation last year and have experienced the benefits of it. This year as an extension, I wish to be consistent with it. 

#### 3. Double my investment portfolio

This goal is a placeholder to remind me to remain consistent with my investments. The SIPs are ready. Let's do this. 

#### 4. Create two additional income sources

The ultimate goal is to make more money in passive income than my salary. This goal is just a step in that direction.

#### 5. Read 15 books this year

I had the same goal last year, and I completed it. I am increasing the difficulty this time by adding more academic books.

#### 6. Learn Video Editing

I have always wanted to create content. Video editing will help me create more content.  

#### 7. Learn Poster Designing

Same as above, I believe poster designing will help me create more content. 

#### 8. Learn to cook five dishes

I wish to get better at my cooking skills. Adding five more dishes to my list. 

#### 9. Travel to 3 new places 

I wish to explore more southern parts of India. I will travel more in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka. 


Cheers!
