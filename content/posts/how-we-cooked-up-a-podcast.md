Ever had a goal to start creating content instead of mindlessly devouring it? Well, that was my aim this year. In my previous blog post, I mentioned my desire for a content creation adventure, but let's be honest—I've never been consistent. So, while I won't make any promises about my newfound podcast, I'm here to share the hilarious story of how my friend and I whipped up our entire brand in less time than it takes to bake a pizza!

### The "With Bites" Domain:
We racked our brains for a name that perfectly captured our podcast's essence. And what did we come up with? "With Bites"! It might sound odd, but hey, my friend and I have always bonded over food, so why not sprinkle in some culinary flair? 
Little did we know, even our credit card found the name so delicious that it temporarily blocked itself during the domain purchase. The cost? Just a measly Rs. 200 bucks!

### Cooking Up a Custom Email:
To give our podcast a professional touch, we set up a custom email address using Zoho. And guess what? They served up a piping hot deal with five free professional email accounts. Talk about having the whole party covered!

### The YouTube Recipe:
We couldn't resist the sizzle of video content, so we cooked up a YouTube channel faster than you can say "spaghetti carbonara." Armed with our fresh email address, we requested the magical Stream Key. 
Why bother with editing? We're proudly lazy, my friend and I. We're diving headfirst into live streaming. But hey, we'll get better at screen sharing — baby steps, you know?

### Baking a Blog:
Every podcast needs a side dish, right? So, we whipped up our very own [blog](https://withbites.fun/). We put our chef's hats on and created a GitHub account, finding solace in the sweet, free hosting goodness provided by Cloudflare. Voila! Our blog was ready to tantalize the taste buds of the internet without burning a hole in our wallets.

### Serving Our Podcast to the Masses:
What's a meal without sharing it with others? We joined RedCircle, a podcast-hosting platform that allowed us to spread our podcasts far and wide. We served up our episodes on various podcasting platforms and the best part? It didn't cost us a single penny!


### Future Plans:
While we can't predict the longevity of our podcast, we've got some exciting plans simmering on the back burner:

#### Perfecting the Recipe: 
Our makeshift mic is a joke, but not a funny one. We're determined to upgrade and serve crystal-clear audio to our listeners. No more mumbling like undercooked potatoes! We'll invest in top-notch audio equipment to create an audio experience that will make listeners melt like gooey cheese on a pizza.

#### Mastering the Art of Garnish: 
Right now, our podcast is as plain as unbuttered toast. But fear not! We're concocting plans to sprinkle in some visual aids, A-roll, B-roll, you name it. We'll transform our episodes into a visual feast! We'll take our screen-sharing skills to the next level, making our live streams more visually appealing than a gourmet cooking show. Get ready for some serious food for thought!

#### Expanding the Menu: 
Our blog and website are hungry for more content. We'll whip up a storm, posting blogs, projects, and recipes that will leave our audience drooling for more.

#### Growing Our Foodie Community: 
We're thinking Instagram, my friend! We'll plate up mouthwatering visuals, engage with our audience, and create a community of like-minded foodies eager to savor our podcast.


In conclusion, starting a podcast with a friend doesn't have to be as complicated as a five-course meal. With a dash of creativity, a sprinkle of laughter, and the right ingredients, you can whip up your own brand in no time. Embrace the process, have fun, and remember to enjoy every tasty moment. Who knows? Your podcast may just become a delectable delight that leaves people craving seconds!
